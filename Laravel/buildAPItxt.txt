app/http/controllers
-Controllers are responsible for controlling the flow of the application execution.
 When you make a request (means request a page) to MVC application, 
a controller is responsible for returning the response to that request.
 The controller can perform one or more actions. 
The controller action can return different types of action results to a particular request.

The Controller is responsible for controlling the application logic and acts as the coordinator between the View and the Model.
 The Controller receives an input from the users via the View, then processes the user's data with the help of Model and passes
the results back to the View.

php artisan make:controller ProductController --api

php artisan route::list

Migrate a Specific Migration File

$ php artisan migrate:refresh --path=database/migrations/2021_05_01_092040_create_products_table.php
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Model

The Model component corresponds to all the data-related logic that the user works with.
 This can represent either the data that is being transferred between the View and Controller
 components or any other business logic-related data. For example, 
a Customer object will retrieve the customer information from the database,
 manipulate it and update it data back to the database or use it to render data.


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
View

The View component is used for all the UI logic of the application.
 For example, the Customer view will include all the UI components such as text boxes,
 dropdowns, etc. that the final user interacts with.
